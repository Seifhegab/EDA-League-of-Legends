It is two Dashboards by Excel and PowerBI that show details of champions in league of legends and show some insights and relations between champions and make analysis with excel and using pivot table and use DAX function in PowerBI.

As we see we get the number of champions and the count of Range and Melee champions and make also Slicers to distinguish some specific data if we want insights of champions which difficulty is intermediate only or champions which are Melee or Ranged we got chart whoch say how many champions realesed in every year and theprice of these champions and base HP and Mana (power) of them and in the up a small table which you choose the champion you want to see the dtails of it.
